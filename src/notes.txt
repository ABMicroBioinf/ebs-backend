ssh -L 27017:localhost:27017 me@myhost

Hey Jack, thank you, that is super interesting. I completely skip the “More Options” and SSH Login of Compass now and do the following:

in my local terminal ssh -L 27017:localhost:27017 me@myhost
Create a new connection inside Compass to localhost with User/Pass Auth of the remote DB
Connect – it works :smile:
That’s a great solution, I didn’t know something like this was possible. I still don’t really understand why it doesn’t work with the SSH Options inside Compass, but this looks like a super future proof solution. Thanks!
